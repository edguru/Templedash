Connect React SDK

##### Connect React SDK

# ERC-4337 Smart Accounts

Convert any wallet to a ERC-4337 smart account to your application.

- Let users **connect to their smart account** using any personal wallet, including in-app wallets for easy onboarding.
- Automatically **deploy individual account contracts** for your users when they do their first onchain transaction.
- **Sponsor gas costs for all transactions** via the thirdweb paymaster.

### Sponsored transactions

To set up sponsored transactions, set the `sponsorGas` option to `true` in the smart account configuration.
All transactions performed with the smart account will then be sponsored by your application. Testnet transactions are free, but you need a valid credit card on file for mainnet transactions.

## Live Playground

Try out in-app wallets for yourself in the [in-app wallet live playground](https://playground.thirdweb.com/connect/account-abstraction/connect)

## Usage with Connect UI components

The easiest way to get started with account abstraction is to use the [ConnectButton](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/ConnectButton) component. Simply add the `accountAbstraction` property with the desired chain and whether to sponsor gas for your users.

With this property, all connected wallets will be automatically converted to smart accounts. The connected wallet will be the admin wallet of the smart account.

```relative block whitespace-pre rounded-lg border bg-card font-mono text-sm leading-relaxed

import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { sepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";
import { ThirdwebProvider, ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
});

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider>
      <ConnectButton
        client={client}
        accountAbstraction={{
          chain: sepolia, // the chain where your smart accounts will be or is deployed
          sponsorGas: true, // enable or disable sponsored transactions
        }}
      />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}

```

You can also make it so _only_ in-app wallets get converted to smart accounts, by configuring the in-app wallet individually. Other external wallets will not be converted to smart accounts with this setup.

```relative block whitespace-pre rounded-lg border bg-card font-mono text-sm leading-relaxed

import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { sepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";
import { ThirdwebProvider, ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
});

const wallets = [\
  inAppWallet({\
    // only configure smart accounts for in-app wallets\
    smartAccount: {\
      chain: sepolia,\
      sponsorGas: true,\
    },\
  }),\
  // other external wallets will not become smart accounts\
  createWallet("io.metamask"),\
  createWallet("rainbow.me"),\
];

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider>
      <ConnectButton client={client} wallets={wallets} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}

```

## Usage with your own UI

You can also use the connection hooks and functions to connect to your smart accounts and build your fully custom UI.

```relative block whitespace-pre rounded-lg border bg-card font-mono text-sm leading-relaxed

import { useConnect } from "thirdweb/react";
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";
import { sepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";

function App() {
  // 1. set the `accountAbstraction` configuration to convert wallets to smart accounts
  const { connect } = useConnect({
    client,
    accountAbstraction: {
      chain: sepolia, // the chain where your smart accounts will be or is deployed
      sponsorGas: true, // enable or disable sponsored transactions
    },
  });

  const connectToSmartAccount = async () => {
    // 2. connect with the admin wallet of the smart account
    connect(async () => {
      const wallet = inAppWallet(); // or any other wallet
      await wallet.connect({
        client,
        chain: sepolia,
        strategy: "google",
      });
      return wallet;
    });
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={() => connectToSmartAccount()}>Connect</button>
  );
}

```

### Auto connection of smart accounts

When building your own UI, remember to also pass the `accountAbstraction` prop to `useAutoConnect` to always reconnect to the smart account on page reload.

Refer to the [Smart Wallet API reference](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/smartWallet) for more advanced configuration of your smart accounts.
