# Overview

Puppet Runner is an NFT-powered infinite runner game that combines gaming mechanics with blockchain functionality. Players run through a 3D environment collecting coins and avoiding obstacles. The application's core focus has shifted to a personalized AI companion system, with the game itself becoming a mini-game feature. This project integrates NFT characters that affect gameplay, allowing players to earn rewards and unlock content through NFT ownership, all while interacting with an AI companion. The business vision is to blend interactive AI with Web3 gaming, offering unique, personalized experiences and leveraging blockchain for digital ownership and rewards.
